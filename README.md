#Mutual Information
Calculates the mutual information between all residues based on the distance difference between the mean position and the position at every frame

MIchi1 calculates the mutual information for the first chi angle and creates a full matrix, making i,j pairs where either i or j is a GLY or ALA zero. 

The MI_fluctuation excecution script can be adapted for either.
